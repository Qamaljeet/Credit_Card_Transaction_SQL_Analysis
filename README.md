# Credit_Card_Transaction_SQL_Analysis

1. Conducted high level analysis using SQL to understand consumer trends and interests by looking at the type 
of purchases people make based on their expense type, gender, and city.
2. Used Subquery, CTEs, JOINs, Window functions etc. to write complex calculations, highest including month 
over month spending for card and expense type, city wise highest and lowest expense type, cumulative 
total for each card type etc.
